# Early Detection of Bearing Degradation
Early detection of bearing degradation using IMS vibration signal data and time series segmentation methods

This is my capstone project as part of the **Spring 2024 Applied Analytics Practicum (MGT 6748)** at [**Georgia Tech Online Masterâ€™s in Analytics**](https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees/analytics).  The project sponsor was Sandia National Labs, who tasked students with building a classifier on signal data to identify "healthy" vs. "faulty" signal.
